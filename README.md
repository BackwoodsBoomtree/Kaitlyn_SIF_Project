# Kaitlyn SIF Project

The scripts here are for Kaitlyn's SIF project.

## Scripts

*Aggregate_Flash_Drought.R - This script aggregates Jordan Christian's v02 flash drought maps to 0.20 to match TROPOMI. Outputs a TIF for start date and length of flash drought. Uses neariest neighbor resampling (you can think of the start day and length as a classification rather than a continuous variable).
